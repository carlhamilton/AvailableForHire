 /// I have uploaded my CV as previously I have made it my mission to learn IT skills but generally these were:
 /// CISCO, MCSE, A+ and Windows/Mac experience.
 /// I ran a business repairing and installing new systems for small businesses or just the general public
 /// My passion though has always been coding but for years stupidly I believed I wouldn't be good enough!..
 /// I no longer believe this and let me tell you anyone can learn to code.
 /// There is no better feeling than when you complete a project and it runs without issues, I get the same feeling similar to 
 /// when my daughter was born. Coding is amazing and do not let anyone tell you otherwise.
